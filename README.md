# libsigrokdecode - IR-Unknown

![decoded-signal](/decoder-screenshot.png "Decoded Signal")

This decoder library was written to decode the signals from semi-no-name A/C units. Nordic Digit-Cool, and clones.

It assumes the use of a sensor that removes the carrier signal (eg, no 38khz/40khz signal, just the highs and lows)
